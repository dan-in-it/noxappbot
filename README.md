## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dan-in-it/noxappbot.git
cd noxappbot
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Create Discord Application

1. Visit the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click **"New Application"** and name it (e.g., "Guild Application Bot")
3. Go to the **"Bot"** tab
4. Click **"Reset Token"** and **copy the token immediately**
5. **Important:** Keep this token secure - it's your bot's password!

### 3. Configure Environment

```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your favorite text editor
# Add your bot token and category ID
```

Your `.env` file should look like:
```env
# Required Configuration
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="your_actual_bot_token_here"
INTERVIEW_CATEGORY_ID="your_category_id_here"

# Optional Role Configuration
OFFICER_ROLE_ID="123456789012345678"

# Optional Bot Configuration
APPLICATION_CHANNEL_PREFIX="application"
LOG_LEVEL="INFO"
```

### **Required Configuration**

**Getting the Category ID:**
1. In Discord: **User Settings ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Enable Developer Mode**
2. Right-click your desired category ‚Üí **"Copy Category ID"**

### **Optional Configuration**

**Role IDs (for automatic access to application channels):**
1. **Officer Role ID:** Right-click your officer role ‚Üí **"Copy Role ID"**
2. **Admin Role ID:** Right-click your admin role ‚Üí **"Copy Role ID"**
3. Leave empty (`""`) if you don't want automatic role access

**Bot Settings:**
- **APPLICATION_CHANNEL_PREFIX:** Channel name prefix (default: `application`)
- **LOG_LEVEL:** Logging level (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`)

### 4. Invite Bot to Server

1. In Discord Developer Portal: **OAuth2 ‚Üí URL Generator**
2. **Scopes:** Select `bot` and `applications.commands`
3. **Bot Permissions:**
   - ‚úÖ Manage Channels
   - ‚úÖ Send Messages
   - ‚úÖ Embed Links
   - ‚úÖ Read Message History
4. Copy the generated URL and authorize the bot to your server

### 5. Test Configuration (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
python test_bot.py
```

This validates your setup before running the bot.

### 6. Start the Bot

```bash
python src/bot.py
```

You should see:
```
INFO:__main__:Bot logged in as YourBotName (ID: 123456789)
INFO:__main__:Application bot is ready and listening for applications
```

## üìñ Usage Guide

### Setting Up Applications

1. **Post the Application Button** (Administrator only):
   ```
   /noxpost
   ```
   Use this slash command in the channel where you want the application button.

2. **Application Flow:**
   - User clicks "Apply to Guild" button
   - Bot sends first question via DM
   - User responds in DM, bot automatically sends next question
   - Process continues until all 7 questions are answered
   - Bot creates private channel: `application-{username}`
   - Application is posted as an embed in the new channel
   - User gets confirmation with channel link

### Managing Applications

**Available Commands:**
- `/noxapprove` - Approve an application with optional welcome message and flexible channel cleanup timing
- `/noxreject` - Reject an application with optional reason and flexible channel cleanup timing
- `/noxsync` - Force sync slash commands (Admin only)

**Application Management:**
- **Private Channels:** Each application gets its own private channel
- **Access Control:** Only the applicant and configured roles can see the channel
- **Review Process:** Officers can discuss applications privately in these channels
- **Approval/Rejection:** Use slash commands to approve or reject with automatic notifications
- **Automatic Cleanup:** Optionally schedule channel deletion after approval/rejection

**Command Examples:**
```
# Approve with automatic deletion in 10 minutes
/noxapprove welcome_message:"Welcome to our raiding team!" delete_time:10m

# Reject with automatic deletion in 1 hour
/noxreject reason:"Needs more experience" delete_time:1h

# Approve with automatic deletion in 24 hours
/noxapprove welcome_message:"Great to have you!" delete_time:24h

# Reject without automatic deletion
/noxreject reason:"Application incomplete"

# Approve with deletion in 30 minutes
/noxapprove delete_time:30m
```

**Time Format Options:**
- **Minutes:** Use `m` suffix (e.g., `10m`, `30m`, `45m`)
- **Hours:** Use `h` suffix (e.g., `1h`, `2h`, `24h`)
- **Backwards Compatibility:** Plain numbers are treated as hours (e.g., `24` = `24h`)
- **Limits:** Minimum 1 minute, maximum 1 week (10080m or 168h)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

### Modifying Questions

Edit the `questions` list in [`src/bot.py`](src/bot.py:21-29):

```python
questions = [
    "Which raid team are you applying to? Weekday (Tues/Mon), Weekend (Fri/Sat/Sun), (10m Wed/Thurs), Floater/Casual",
    "Have you reviewed the raid schedule for the team you're applying for?",
    "Is there a certain class/spec/role that you prefer to play?",
    "Please provide a link to your Warcraft Logs page for the character(s) you're applying with",
    "Do you currently have any friends or family in the guild? If so, who?",
    "Tell us about yourself and your raiding experience",
    "Any additional comments/questions?"
]
```

**Important:** You can modify the number of questions as needed. The DM-based system handles any number of questions sequentially.

### Adding Officer/Admin Role Access

To give specific roles access to application channels, modify the `overwrites` in [`src/bot.py`](src/bot.py:95-100):

```python
# Get your officer role ID (right-click role ‚Üí Copy ID with Developer Mode enabled)
OFFICER_ROLE_ID = 123456789012345678  # Replace with actual ID

# In the overwrites dictionary:
overwrites = {
    guild.default_role: discord.PermissionOverwrite(read_messages=False),
    self.member: discord.PermissionOverwrite(read_messages=True, send_messages=True),
    guild.get_role(OFFICER_ROLE_ID): discord.PermissionOverwrite(read_messages=True, send_messages=True),
}
```

### Adjusting Response Handling

The DM-based system automatically handles responses of any length. Discord DM messages have a 2000 character limit, but users can send multiple messages if needed. The bot will wait for each response before proceeding to the next question.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Import discord could not be resolved"**
```bash
pip install discord.py python-dotenv
```

**"Bot not responding to commands"**
- Verify bot has proper permissions in your server
- Check that the bot is online (green status)
- Ensure you're using `/noxpost` with administrator permissions
- Make sure slash commands are synced (use `/noxsync` if needed)

**"Interview category not found"**
- Verify the category ID in your `.env` file
- Ensure the bot has access to the category
- Check that the category still exists

**"Permission denied when creating channels"**
- Bot needs "Manage Channels" permission
- Verify bot role is above the category in role hierarchy

**"DM not received when clicking Apply"**
- Check if your DMs are enabled for server members
- Make sure you don't have an existing application in progress
- Verify the bot can send you direct messages
- Contact an administrator if the issue persists

### Validation Script

Run the test script to diagnose issues:
```bash
python test_bot.py
```

This checks:
- ‚úÖ File structure
- ‚úÖ Dependencies installed
- ‚úÖ Environment variables configured
- ‚úÖ Bot configuration validity
